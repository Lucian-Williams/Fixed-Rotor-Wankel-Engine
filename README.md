# Fixed-Rotor-Wankel-Engine
A University Project from Spring 2021 attempting to invert the Wankel engine by fixing the triangular rotor in place and having the housing be the moving part.

[A visual comparison of the basic geometry of a Wankel engine (left) and the new geometry (right) where the central red shape is stationary, the blue component is a single moving part, and the black component bounds the space required for the rotor to move freely.](/Pictures/Wankel vs Fixed Rotor.PNG)
