# Fixed-Rotor-Wankel-Engine
A University Technical Communications course project (individiual) from Spring 2021 attempting to invert the Wankel engine geometry by fixing the triangular rotor in place and having the housing be the moving part.

A Wankel engine exploits the idea that a triangular rotor rotating on an eccentric shaft (the center of the rotor must orbit at a rate three times that of the rotor's rotation rate) traces a peanut shaped path that can be made into a housing and used to generate power like a traditional internal combustion engine. In this project I explore inverting this concept, inspired by LiquidPiston's work, which involves a very similar approach.

In the above image, The basic geometry of the Wankel engine is on the left, where the red central shaft and black housing are fixed parts and the red triangular rotor orbits freely within the interior space of the housing. The new geometry on the right represents the basic geometry of both my design and the LiquidPiston design. The red component in the center is fixed while the blue peanut rotor orbits within the black housing. The difference between the LiquidPiston geometry and mine is that in the LiquidPiston design, combustion only occurs in the space between the rotor and the housing, with the red component absent,  while in my design, combustion occurs between the red component and the blue rotor, and the outer housing is absent from my design.

The front view of my stator design, the core of the engine. The 6-tooth gear is probably not the best of choices (30 teeth would likely be more sensible), but it was an artistic decision. The eccentric shaft slots in from the back of the stator and is held in place by the back plate that is fixed to the stator.

The back view of my stator design. The screw holes for the back plate are visible. The apparent gear at the back of the back plate is not actually a gear but is my conception of a part that permits the engine to be mounted to a test rig. However, it occurs to me now that unless it is welded to the rig, it is not a satisfactory mounting point. Oh well.
